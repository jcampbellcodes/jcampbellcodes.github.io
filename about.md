> "Something tells me there's a bright future ahead for Jack Campbell."
> - Andrea Swensson, MPR (Minnesota Public Radio)

<center>
Colorado-based Jack Campbell & the Head Mess draws on the Minneapolis 
songwriting tradition of stuffing infectious pop earworms and unique harmonic flavors
into a fuzzy garage rock package. Their danceable indie rock veneer, akin to influences such as Sondre Lerche, the Replacements, and Elvis Costello, conceals deeper themes of mental health and relationship struggles.
<br>
<br>

Following the feature of their single "Absentee" on hit podcast Welcome to Night Vale, the group has captivated hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe.
<br>
<br>
Jack's 2019 release, Lucky Break, comes off the heels of finding his new
home base on the Colorado Front Range via Chicago, where he moved to build audio effects and guitar pedals by day and play his tunes at dives by night.

Their latest single "Second Thoughts" is now available on all streaming platforms.

<br/>
I am a musician and audio programmer originally from Duluth, Minnesota. I went to school and worked in the
game industry for several years in Chicago, IL before becoming a software engineer at Universal Audio in
Boulder, CO.

Professionally, I have designed and maintained game engines in C++ and Typescript and I currently help maintain
Universal Audio's UAD audio plugin platform.

As a musician I have toured around the Midwest and released several records over the years, which can be
found on my Bandcamp below.
