> "Something tells me there's a bright future ahead for Jack Campbell."
> - Andrea Swensson, MPR (Minnesota Public Radio)

<center>
Based in Colorado, Jack Campbell & the Head Mess draws on the Minneapolis 
punk rock tradition of stuffing catchy pop earworms
into a gritty garage rock package. Led by singer-songwriter Jack Campbell, 
the band has been bringing a decade's worth of tunes about relationships and 
mental health to life, with the help of screamin' sax solos and grungey basslines. 
<br>
<br>
Jack's latest release, Lucky Break (2019), comes off the heels of finding his new
home base on the Colorado Front Range, where he moved to build audio effects and guitar pedals
by day and play his tunes at dives by night.
<br>
<br>
His music has found a worldwide audience following the release of 
Absentee (2013) and its feature during a Welcome to Night Vale weather segment, 
with much of his fanbase spread throughout the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands.

<br/>
I am a musician and audio programmer originally from Duluth, Minnesota. I went to school and worked in the
game industry for several years in Chicago, IL before becoming a software engineer at Universal Audio in
Boulder, CO.

Professionally, I have designed and maintained game engines in C++ and Typescript and I currently help maintain
Universal Audio's UAD audio plugin platform.

As a musician I have toured around the Midwest and released several records over the years, which can be
found on my Bandcamp below.
